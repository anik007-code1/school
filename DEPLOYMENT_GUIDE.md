## Admin Panel Access

3. **Manage Homepage Slider**: Upload images, set titles and captions, control slide order
4. **All existing features**: Notices, Teachers, Committee, etc.

## Troubleshooting

### If you get URL reverse errors:
The templates now use hardcoded URLs (`/students/`, `/exam-results/`) instead of URL reversing to avoid namespace issues.

### If migrations fail:
1. Check database permissions
2. Ensure all model dependencies are in place
3. Run migrations step by step if needed

### If static files don't load:
1. Run `python manage.py collectstatic`
2. Check STATIC_ROOT and STATIC_URL settings
3. Verify web server static file configuration

## Testing After Deployment

1. Visit homepage - check if slider appears (may show gradient background if no images uploaded)
2. Navigate to `/students/` - should show student statistics
3. Navigate to `/exam-results/` - should show exam results with filtering
4. Test mobile navigation menu
5. Access admin panel and verify new models are available

## Notes

- The slider will show a gradient background if no images are uploaded
- Sample data command creates realistic student and exam data for testing
- All new features are fully responsive and mobile-friendly
- Admin interfaces include bulk operations and advanced filtering
